# Online-Trip-Planner
The project aims to design an interactive online trip planner that helps users plan their vacations and road trips efficiently. The planner involves planning, selecting, organizing, and arranging typography, photographs, graphics, illustrations, colors, and videos. It also allows users to input accommodation, transport, itinerary details, share trips, forward confirmation emails, and send real-time alerts. The project focuses on main options, graphical guidelines, and goals, including location search, exploration, destination input, suggested itinerary, sightseeing locations, and balanced incorporation of video or text.
